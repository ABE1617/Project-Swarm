// This is a placeholder for the jsPlumb library.
// In a real implementation, you would include the actual jsPlumb library here,
// but since we cannot directly include binary files, you would need to include
// the library via CDN in your HTML instead.

// The HTML template references jsPlumb via:
// <script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/jsplumb.min.js') }}"></script>

// For a real implementation, replace the script tag in the HTML with:
// <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jsPlumb/2.15.6/js/jsplumb.min.js"></script>

// Alternatively, create this file with the following line to proxy the CDN:
document.write('<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jsPlumb/2.15.6/js/jsplumb.min.js"></script>');
